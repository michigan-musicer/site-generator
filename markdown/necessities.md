A discussion of things that should be prioritized alongside professional goals.

It's possible to find professional success in the short, medium, even long term without taking care of these things much. However, not taking care of these things can cause a lot of damage that ends up affecting your professional results. More importantly, later in life most people get priorities other than professional success, and being in a good place with these other things is helpful for working on those others parts of your life. Hence the suggestion to work on these alongside professional matters.

In some cases, these have to take priority over professional goals. For example, if you are undergoing a physical or mental health crisis, treating that should in 99% of cases come before working on your professional goals.  

[^0]: not a medical professional, that 99% is a number I came up with. My point is health crises are going to significantly dent your professional progress.

Sometimes people put these to the side to focus on professional things. This is fine every now and then, but overdoing it can lead to problems.
