# Heading

## subheading

### subsubheading

#### subsubsubheading

Some text!

Here's an apostrophe.

Text with a footnote.

- A list.
- item 2.
- item 3.

[^0]: A footnote is implemented as an aside element. Doesn't have to follow typical markdown usage like we've had in the past, but if so do keep in mind footnoes cannot be lazily placed and found.

Some text that is **bold**, *emphasized*, and ***both***.

> A quote.

{caveat}: a caveat to a point.

Can be multiple lines.

{/caveat}

{opinion}: a personal opinion.

Can be multiple lines.

{/opinion}

{numbers}: by the numbers - data and such.

Can be multiple lines.

{/numbers}
