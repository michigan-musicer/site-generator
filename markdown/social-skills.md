title: Social Skills

In the US, teachers usually do not teach social skills directly. Instead, . In a computer science curriculum, 

Many people believe that social skills are something you are born with and that you can't really get better at them over time. This isn't true; (evidence). Moreover, different social groups will have different social norms - in particular, professional and personal social skills are very different, and what works with friends often doesn't work with colleagues.

There's plenty of reasons someone might not have good social skills. Sometimes it is just that the person is "asocial", but someone might have had asocial / abusive family, or they might have attended low-quality schools growing up, or they might have been in a community growing up that rejected them - all of these hinder social skill development through no fault of the student themselves. Conversely, students who have family or other close connections who are well educated and/or in academic roles can have an advantage.

[^0]: in particular consider students who grew up poor while attending a wealthier school, or students whose identity clashes with their community (esp. LGBTQ+), or students who have goals that are very different from the goals of people around them, or...

{caution} Social norms are subjective depending on the group, so it's not helpful if I discuss how to navigate specific social circumstances or try to walk you through every single possible social interaction

# Personal social skills

Be nice.

[^0]: However, being nice sometimes means you get used and rolled over by people who are fine with mistreating you. Good people do not do this, but not everyone you meet will be a good person. 

Be free in meeting people but be careful in choosing friends. Toxic friends can be worse for your health than loneliness. This is context-dependent, but usually if you feel *bad* around your friends, then they probably aren't good friends to keep.

[^0]: It's also possible you are the problem - some toxic people struggle to realize that their behaviors harm the people around them. If you find that all of your friends are "bad" friends, that *can* indicate that you are the problem, but it isn't necessarily indicative. In some cases (consider sexual orientation, race, political beliefs, ...), you may have some quality or background that makes you dissonant from the average person in your community, especially if it is not a diverse community, and that doesn't necessarily indicate something wrong with you.

# Professional social skills

Be nice.

Sometimes you will have to be around people you don't really want to be around. This could be with respect to their way of working, their working philosophy, or their personal qualities. . In extreme cases, e.g. harassment, document problematic interactions and bring them up with your manager and/or HR. A good company will deal with the issue; a bad company will try to sweep it under the rug (in which case prepare to look for a new job). 

Your coworkers' most important resource is time. Avoid wasting people's time because it's one of the fastest ways to make them annoyed at you. This does *not* mean avoid your coworkers or silo off, because if you don't know how to do something and fall behind on a task, then that will be a time cost for them later down the line.

It's common 

Avoid controversial topics .

[^0]: There is an unfortunate corollary from this, which is that it's "best" to be inoffensive and to avoid discussing difficult but sometimes necessary topics. In the long run I think this hinders a community's development and can cause dramatic schisms when these issues do flare up. But there isn't much good that can be done from immediately throwing youself onto the sword or constantly bringing this kind of thing up (because what matters is how other people perceive it regardless of how much YOU know it to be an important thing) - addressing these kinds of things usually requires some trust from the relevant community and nuanced conversation / compromising with community members. (People suck at compromising these days so this is particularly herculean today.)

Never badmouth people. In undergrad, you can readily complain about professors or school administrators because people by and large are not interested in punishing undergrads. But once you matter and people have good reasons to bear grudges, you really don't want to give people ammunition to shoot you down with.

[^0]: At least schools are not supposed to retaliate against students. In practice it does happen, but if there's proof then it's much worse for the university, particularly public universities that have to follow certain regulations / laws. You may be likelier to see retaliation / scummy behavior at private schools. Also the case of Mahmoud Khalil is relevant here.

## Dealing with drama

One of the unfortunate realities about adulthood is that drama is more or less universal. Corporate drama? You bet - in a small group, one or two people with big egos can completely derail overall group direction, and in large groups, whatever changing whims from up high can rapidly throw around lower-levels' objectives and goals (to the lower-levels' considerable consternation) - to say nothing of toxic workplaces that enable harassment and such. In academia, senior profs reject papers due to personal grudges, and others in the academic sphere will (unfairly) judge PhD students working under someone with a bad reputation. On a micro level, colleagues can differ in how they see each other.

[^0]: Ever had a colleague who was more personal with you than you wanted? I have experienced that colleague and I have been that colleague myself. It gets uncomfortable and affects the working relationship.

If you aren't involved in drama, don't get involved in drama. When emotions are actively running high, there's really no good that comes from addional people stepping in. Don't be some heroic sacrifice over whether project A takes X or Y direction.

The tricky part is when you do get involved in drama, and if you are an important player in something that people care about and have differing opinions on, then you will eventually get involved in drama. First: don't instantly back down. . Additionally, if you do immediately back down, people will take it to mean that they can have their way around you, and you will need to do additional work to fight for your point of view.

[^0]: I have this hypothesis that most people unconsciously feel the need to experience the full range of emotions, including anger / disgust / blahblahblah, on a regular basis, and so they hook up to drama as a way to fulfill that need for that emotion. Don't think that's scientifically supported and that's neither here nor there.
