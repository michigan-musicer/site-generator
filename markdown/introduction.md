# Introduction

There are plenty of guides written by more-or-less qualified individuals on how to write a resume, how to practice for interviews, how to write your statement of purpose for graduate school applications...there's a lot of emphasis on these kinds of relatively little assessments that do not capture the essence of everything that you will have to do in a CS college career. Consider in particular these "soft" questions: 

- How do I connect with my professional community?
- How do I stay productive enough to become professionally successful?
- How do I stay productive enough to not damage my health?
- How do I decide something to focus my career on?
- How do I make myself attractive long-term in the job market? (Highly correlated with the previous question!)

For some people, answering these soft questions is not so difficult. For others, answering these questions is not that important, at least at this point in time. For the rest, this book is my attempt to answer as someone with just a little bit more experience who ran the gauntlet recently enough to be relevant. 

<!-- This should start with credit to others once you have others to credit. --->
{caveat}: When you take advice from someone, it should matter how trustworthy that person is (ethos and all that). To that end, my qualifications: I am an incoming PhD student at **insert PhD here**. I graduated from a top 10 university for computer science (University of Michigan) with bachelor's and master's degrees in computer science. I worked two summer internships, participated in undergraduate and graduate-level research, and worked as a teaching assistant for four semesters in three different classes. In 2023-2024 I served as a Fulbright Scholar in Poland, where I taught English and computer science in a rural Polish city (cześć studenci!). I applied for full-time entry level roles in mid-2024, landed two offers, took one, then applied for PhDs starting in 2025 and landed two offers. 

In short, I have experienced a lot of things and can speak to a lot of different paths in life. However, I'm not necessarily the best to ask about each individual path, especially if you put weight on a program's "prestige level" (I am not a FAANG engineer or a PhD at a top 5 school with a long list of publications). You should decide for yourself if that disqualifies my advice from applying to you.

This book is largely based on my experiences, but I have done my best to draw from other experiences and read up on relevant research to support these takes.
{/caveat} 

Part of what this book tries to address is the knowledge gap between "typical" students and first-generation students. A lot of useful "how-to" is information that is never officially communicated for one reason or another, and without networking with the right people, it's possible to never encounter this information. This can be things like what opportunities are good, how people balance their lives, what it takes to get X or Y position, etcetera. 

[^0]: In practice you do not need to strictly qualify as first-gen to have knowledge gaps. Maybe your parents went to college but you have a poor relationship with them and do not / cannot rely on them for advice. Maybe your parents went to college, but you are from a different country where higher education follows different unspoken rules from the US. In general I believe there is a generational gap between current college students and college students from previous generations, mainly due to the significant increase in competition and what I usually call "hyper-meritocracy" in education.
