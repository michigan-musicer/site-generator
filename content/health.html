<h1>Health</h1>
<p>Hard to keep it up long-term if you aren't maintaining your body and mind for the long-term.</p>
<div class="TODO">
<h3>TODO</h3><p>Probably split this into separate sections for physical, mental, and occupational.</p>
</div>
<h2>Physical</h2>
<h2>Mental</h2>
<h2>Occupational</h2>
<p>In theory not a problem in the same way it is for other professions (OSHA doesn't worry about software developers). In practice - workplace abuse is a thing and can be detrimental to your health.</p>
<aside>TODO: this needs to be fleshed out a bit.</aside>
<h2>What to do in a crisis point</h2>
<p>At this point, online internet advice is not the best option.</p>
<div class="unqualified">
<h3>WHERE I&apos;M NOT QUALIFIED</h3><p>I am online internet advice. I can only share starting steps based on my + others' experiences.</p>
</div>
<p>Seek professional help where possible. The campus may have resources to help connect struggling students to professionals, particularly with academic-related struggles. (Stress related to job-hunting and professional concerns may be a little harder.)</p>
<p>Reach out to professors / people you work with about the issues - usually they don't ask for excessive details, and if you are sincere and explain what's going on then most people are willing to give you time and space to handle things (usually in the form of extended and/or rescheduled  deadlines, dropped assignments...).</p>
<aside>It's harder if someone shows no empathy at all and/or doesn't let you take time to deal with the crisis. Unsure what to advise here, but I would start by seeing what resources the department / university provides for students. Many larger universities in the US have an ombuds / ombudsman, an official responsible for resolving conflicts between students and the university.</aside>
<p>"You are not alone" often sounds like an empty statement, so instead keep in mind that there is an abundance of great people (famous and unfamous) who have went through these kinds of crisis points. A crisis point is not a failure point; it's life, and life is surviveable.</p>
