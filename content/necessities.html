<div class="main"><p>A discussion of things that should be prioritized alongside professional goals.</p>
<p>It's possible to find professional success in the short, medium, even long term without taking care of these things much. However, not taking care of these things can cause a lot of damage that ends up affecting your professional results. More importantly, later in life most people get priorities other than professional success, and being in a good place with these other things is helpful for working on those others parts of your life. Hence the suggestion to work on these alongside professional matters.</p>
<p>In some cases, these have to take priority over professional goals. For example, if you are undergoing a physical or mental health crisis, treating that should in 99% of cases come before working on your professional goals.  </p>
<aside>not a medical professional, that 99% is a number I came up with. My point is health crises are going to significantly dent your professional progress.</aside>
<p>Sometimes people put these to the side to focus on professional things. This is fine every now and then, but overdoing it can lead to problems.</p>
