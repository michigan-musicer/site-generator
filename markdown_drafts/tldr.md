This is a one-page summary of the most important points in this book. If you only have 5 minutes or less, read this and come back to this book later if you find the advice interesting.

Find mentors you can trust. Careers and life in general are complicated, so book advice will never be as good as advice from someone who is competent and who has your best interest at heart.

Do not do this solely for money *if* you want a long and happy-ish career. It's perfectly valid to do this for a short time (<5 years) to make money, then switch to something else; but it's hard to be a successful senior if you don't actually care about computer science or software engineering at all.

You need both technical skills and social skills. The weaker of the two limits you at any given point - technical because you need to be able to create, social because you need to be able to convince people your creations matter.

You do not get to exclusively do whatever you want. You need to do what is demanded of you - by your boss, your stakeholders, by the market, by need in the wider community... The corollary of this is that you will have to do unpleasant / boring / stupid tasks regardless of which route you take post-graduation.  

[^0]: Doing what you want is still important, and you should find some degree of niche that makes you feel fulfilled. The main point is that you as an engineer will not be making higher-level decisions like what projects get prioritized, what technology you use, which stakeholders you report to, etcetera.

Don't worry so much about the exact place you want to go yet. Have a general vision and take steps towards that vision, but especially early on, lessons from almost any experience will apply to the next one, so as long as you're doing *something* then nothing is really a waste of time.

[^0]: This needs some caveats. There are projects that mean nothing. For example, writing a static website using only HTML and CSS counts for nothing nowadays. If you want to get into kernel or driver development, writing a basic function in assembly code will not get your foot in the door (even if assembly can be challenging for undergrads learning it for the first time). This is more in reference to internships and first jobs out of college - you don't need a perfect first position to have a great career, and you don't need to immediately be in a particular field in order to be in that field later. Do note later in your career that some jobs just won't have you working with tools or concepts that are "best practice" in a particular space, and that *does* have a serious effect on your ability to grow in that space. More on this in a separate section.

Get good at selling yourself. Learn how to identify what people care about, how to tell convincing stories, and how to defend your work against skeptics and critics.

**Finish projects.** For your career story, a crappy idea that is implemented and functional is way more valuable than a great idea that is half-baked and crashes during runtime, especially for early-in-career engineers.

Your college curriculum should at minimum have courses on data structures and algorithms, ... If your school doesn't have one of these classes, then your degree would not be a legitimate CS degree according to (accredition org name). If your school half-bakes one of these classes, consider finding time to focus on it more so that you aren't missing critical information.

(I don't actually know for sure what is in a "standard" strong college curriculum. Maybe find some CS ed papers and go back to this? There should also be an accredition organization that specifies what schools need to have.)

Figure out what defines you as a professional versus you as a living, breathing miracle of life on this earth. Workaholism is a common escape mechanism for people who haven't figured out the latter, and it never really works. Moreover, if too much of your self-worth is tied to your career or accomplishments or some vacuous sense of "pride", it becomes very easy for bad people to manipulate and use you for their own purposes.
