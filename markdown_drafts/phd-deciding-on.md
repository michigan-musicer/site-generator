title: Deciding on a PhD
---

A long time ago I listened to an online course on distributed systems which opened with "The first rule of distributed systems is: don't do distributed systems". The first rule of a PhD is similar: don't do a PhD.

Might sound weird coming from a current PhD student, but let me explain.

# You don't need a PhD for almost anything

.

It is even possible to do research in industry with just a master's. Now if you only have a master's, you will not start out leading or creating your own research projects, because those skills are taught in a PhD and people will want to know you have those skills before giving you money to do those things. 

The one thing you do "need" a PhD for . 

[^0]: There is a push to change this; some people in academia think this is nonsensical and want to drop the (effective) doctorate requirement for teaching by setting up master's programs dedicated to CS education instead. It hasn't taken off yet, but do keep an eye out for these programs and look at their placement rate compared to conventional PhD programs. 

# Consider every possibility that isn't a PhD
