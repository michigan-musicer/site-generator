{TODO}: you probably need an actual math major's perspective on the real math portions of this - lots of things will be blank
Alternatively just look at your 487 notes again? the algo class?

Everyone thinks they suck at math, even the ones who are really really good at math. Some people are actually good at math. I would never trust someone who unironically believed they were good at math, because everyone I met who has been good at math has said they are, at best, "not stupid", and as someone who is not deep in the math weeds I have to suspect that they know something I don't about intelligence. 

This is the most important thing - there are a few other things that may not be discussed in your core math classes. (If your CS curriculum does not require core math classes, something is wrong.) They are worth covering here.

## Math is uniquely difficult

"Real" math (i.e. math that ) requires you to sit and think in a way that other disciplines don't really require you to do. You can't memorize patterns or brute-force your way through things; you have to understand the problem thoroughly and find a way to figure it out. 

{TODO}: wdym real math lol

[^0]: Because of that, I think sometimes you find peope saying that math is "purer" or "on a higher level" from other disciplines, particularly applied fields like engineering. That does come with the caveat that some theoretical math is divorced from any real-world application and/or takes a lot of time and ripple effect to actually affect change in other fields - I know mathematicians who have been discontent with that aspect of math.

Sometimes computer science classes turn into a "redo this thing presented in lecture" sort of thing or handhold you through a difficult concept. This isn't as reliable in math because it requires this deeper understanding.

If you take a math major, ideally what you come out with is less so expertise in "linear algebra" or "calculus" or some other specific subject and more so how to think about problems "mathematically", which I do not understand how to put into words tbh. (To my understanding, specializations in math at a research level are much more fine-grained than "linear algebra" or "calculus".)

{TODO}: not the hottest sendoff here mate

## What math do CS majors actually use?

This highly depends what specific thing you're doing. Many software roles don't require math, but specific subfields are very difficult to get into without a lot of time invested into mathematics.

Discrete math fundamentals always help: this means .

There are quite a few usages of randomized algorithms throughout software.

For machine learning stuff, research to improve on existing models / algorithms requires a strong math and/or statistics background. At the very least, you need to be able to navigate whatever asinine thing the latest papers off the press are talking about.



You are likelier to encounter math-y things in graduate school / research-style industry positions than product engineering industry positions. 

## Math vs statistics

Statistics is particularly important for machine learning, .

## What to do if you suck at math

Congratulations! You are a normal person. If you're really struggling, especially if you think that your K-12 education may have been weaker than your peers', look at the following:

- Do you have all the prerequisites you actually need? Check out [Khan Academy's math courses](https://www.khanacademy.org/math) as a first step and skim through the high school courses. You may just be missing prerequisite knowledge. If you are missing things, expect this process to take some time - 
- 

[^0]: Don't be ashamed of going back to kindergarten-level math if you need to - while an extreme case, [this story by Anna H. from MIT](https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/on_teaching_and_learning/) details "seniors in Algebra II who donâ€™t know the difference between subtraction and division". There are lots of reasons why K-12 education might fail to teach these things, and none of these are the fault of the student in question. Unfortunately, with the way that college is structured, most colleges will expect you to have up through the end of high-school level math complete (but see if your institution offers a "math primer" kind of course, for example [UMich's Math 105 course](https://lsa.umich.edu/math/undergraduates/undergraduate-math-courses/100-level-math-courses.html).)

{TODO}: is this actually an extreme case? how unequal is math education in the US?
